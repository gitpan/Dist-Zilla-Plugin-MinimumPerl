NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MinimumPerl - Detects the minimum version of Perl
    required for your dist

VERSION

      This document describes v1.006 of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MinimumPerl - released October 31, 2014 as part of Dist-Zilla-Plugin-MinimumPerl.

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin uses Perl::MinimumVersion to automatically find the minimum
    version of Perl required for your dist and adds it to the prereqs.

            # In your dist.ini:
            [MinimumPerl]

ATTRIBUTES

 perl

    Specify a version of perl required for the dist. Please specify it in a
    format that Build.PL/Makefile.PL understands! If this is specified,
    this module will not attempt to automatically detect the minimum
    version of Perl.

    The default is: undefined ( automatically detect it )

    Example: 5.008008

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

    The plugin uses FileFinders for finding files to scan. The predefined
    finders are listed in "default_finders" in
    Dist::Zilla::Role::FileFinderUser. You can define your own with the
    [FileFinder::ByName] and [FileFinder::Filter] plugins.

    Additionally, all files whose encoding has been specified as bytes are
    omitted from consideration. (See [Encoding] for more information.)

    Each prerequisite phase is configured separately:

 runtime_finder

    Finds files to scan for runtime prerequisites. The default value is
    :InstallModules and :ExecFiles (see also Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ExecDir.

 test_finder

    Finds files to scan for test prerequisites. The default value is
    :TestFiles.

 configure_finder

    Finds files to scan for configure prerequisites. The default value is
    :IncModules.
